# ✈️ Airlines Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing airline data to uncover insights on flight delays, airline performance, and travel patterns. The goal is to provide meaningful visualizations and statistics that can aid in better understanding the aviation industry trends.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/darrendube/airlinedataset), and includes information such as:

- Airline names
- Flight delays
- Departure and arrival times
- Distance
- Weather impact
- Cancellations, and more

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive coding

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Identified airlines with the most delays.
- Analyzed peak delay times and their causes.
- Visualized cancellation rates and reasons.
- Explored correlations between weather and delays.

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

- Heatmaps of delays by time of day
- Bar charts showing delays per airline
- Pie chart for cancellation reasons

## 🚀 How to Run
